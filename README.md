### 2024 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Spaces (2)

### Intro

I have created two parametized outputs, which loops for a second long and works on any scale. which are both very different, as I wanted to explore the different functions I could apply and the different themes I could match it with. This is also so you can pick between two options, depending on what mood you are in for your zoom background!


I have added in the correct navigation for both projects with a dropdown menu. The first one, the techno frog, was from my initial sketch, and the second one came from later stages, when I found out we could do multiple projects.

## 1. Techno Frog

In this project, I intended to create the perplexing ripples that still water creates when it gets disturbed. This would definitely match a background for someone, as you wouldn't get stressed out looking at them.
I was inspired by stone skipping, and added onto this idea a cute frog, as it fitted better with the colour theme. However, I changed my mind a little with the 'peaceful' theme I was going for, and decided I want to portray a scene of music, beats, and [crazy frog](https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-nflid) jumping along to his imaginary tune.


With the parametric side, I have decided to create three rows of frogs jumping along three rows of ripples (or stereos, you choose). In terms of colour palette, I decided to go with the neon, [techno dance party theme](https://openart.ai/discovery/sd-1007158426163486821). I added a glow to the frog to make the main character stand out.


In the later stages, I added a little music note which the frogs passed behind them when they jump, to create a music-sharing-having-fun vibe for the audience. I think this could've been improved by creating a variety of techno colours (or even changing the colours throughout the 1 second), and pondering over which was best. I think the composition turned out well in my opinion, but I definitely should've tried to link the puddle and the frog jumping better.

## 2. The Land of Abundant Honey and a Cow

For this project, I was inspired by the Israelites' history from the [bible](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/exo.3.17), where they were promised [a land of milk and honey](https://kingdompreppers.org/hebrew-articles/2018/7/28/land-of-milk-and-honey) from the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I wanted to depict a mix of: what they would be thinking when they heard this promise, and how I could blend it together without coding a whole landscape/country.


Hence, the cow face made of honeycomb was birthed. The parametric side is the hexagonal shape of the honeycomb, which was very interesting to learn about, through other peoples' projects (linked in source code). In terms of composition, I wanted to focus on the cows face, so it could incorporate both the milk and honey aspect.


For the colour palette, I immediately knew it had to be a range of milk/creamy/honey/golden colours to complement the aesthetic I was going for.


I decided to create shadows later on, so I could bring out the picture and create a little perspective on the output (so it wasn't so flat and boring). When the picture gets blown up for a larger size, you can see that the lines behind the bees slowly simmer off (intentionally), and that the amount of honeycomb gets doubled without the size of the honeycomb. This was to bring a small amount of realism into the picture, as the honeycomb hexagons don't change, only the total size of it.


If I had more time with this, I would definitely incorporate milk splashing around in a mug somewhere. Additionally, I would've created a better route for the bees to go around, as going horizontally halfway through the page seems a little disjointed.

### Thank you

Thank you for exploring and viewing my project, hope you liked it!
